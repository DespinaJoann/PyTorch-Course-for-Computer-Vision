## 🎓 **Welcome to the PyTorch Course for Computer Vision!** 👋  

### **Course Overview and Tutorial Details**  

This course, authored by **Despina Ioanna Chalkiadaki**, provides a **fast-paced yet comprehensive introduction** to the **fundamentals of computer vision**. It’s designed for **everyone**, with a special focus on making it accessible to **undergraduates** and **developers**, without requiring an in-depth understanding of the complex mathematics behind deep learning. Instead, it emphasizes learning through practical, hands-on experimentation.

Computer vision is a rapidly evolving technology that allows machines to interpret and understand visual data. It’s at the heart of innovations like **autonomous vehicles**, **medical imaging**, and **facial recognition systems**. In this course, you’ll gain a solid understanding of the **core principles** of computer vision while working with one of the most powerful frameworks available—**[`PyTorch`](https://pytorch.org/)**.

The **six tutorials** in this series strike a balance between **theory** and **practice**, ensuring that you not only understand the concepts but also know how to apply them to real-world problems. The content is straightforward and approachable, making it easier for anyone to follow, while still providing **in-depth knowledge** without oversimplification. You’ll walk away with a foundational project and the skills to implement it using `PyTorch`.

Additionally, **extra material** will be introduced in the future, covering advanced experiments and a more detailed exploration of each concept. This will help learners further enhance their skills and dive deeper into specific areas of computer vision.

All the code in this course is also **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**, meaning you can upload it directly to `Colab` and run experiments without needing a high-performance computer. This ensures that anyone can follow along, regardless of hardware limitations.
